this sole experiment started on september eleventh twenty twenty five the first wet step was to weigh out the masses and the volumes viide one two one had a volume of one thousand in the leters of water and fifty one milligrims of salt vial with the idetw t two had one thousand and one will leters of water and fifty milligrims of salt bile with the i d e three t three had one thousand and ten miluters of water was fifty two milligames of salt the wing started on june twentieth twenty twenty five at five eleven pm and wing stopped at june twentienth twenty twenty five at five fifteen pm for the stocks solutions the stock stucian had one thousand milliters of water with one thousand mill leaters of ethanal and fiftyen milligrams of salt wing for hi stock solution started on june twentieth twenty twenty five at five nineteen pm and stopped on june twentieth twenty twenty five at five twenty two p m and the o solution was transferred on june twentienth twenty twenty five five twenty three pm for the reaction time line the reaction started at five thirty eastern standard time with addition one happening at six o'clock edition two at six thirty dition three at seven and then it was taken off the plate at eight o'clock for the workup times the bi id enton was worked up on august seventh twenty twenty five starting at nine o'clock and ending at nine oh one bi with the ide one ttwo was worked up on aguess even the twenty twenty five starting at nine oh two and ending at nine oh three and bioe with the i d e ont three was worked up on august seventh twenty twenty five starting at nine oh four and ending at nine oh five for the results the masses of each vil id were as follows eu and t one had a vile mass of two thousand and one and a crue bie mass of two twenty one hundred bile with the i d e en t two had a bile mass of twenty one hundred and a cruel vile mass of two thousand two hundred and bya with the ideonet three had a vile masks of two thousand one hundred and one and a crew biomass of two thousand two hundred and ten for the characterisation by id u n tian was characterized on august eighth twenty twenty five and four milligams of the product was used for enamar and the sec was taken on august seventh twenty twenty five and four milligaans was used for the sec uanti too was characterized on august seventh twent twenty five and four five milligrams of the product was used to measure anamar and the s e c was measured on august seventh twenty twenty five and five milligams was used to characterize as ye ce provile e one t three it teanamar was taken on august seventh twtwenty twenty five and three miligans was used to measure anamar acc was taken onch august seventh twen twenty five and three millgrams was used to characterize the sec
