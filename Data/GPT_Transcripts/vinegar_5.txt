On May fourteenth, twenty twenty-five, I began the sodium hydroxide standardization with potassium hydrogen phthalate.  
For the first trial, I weighed one thousand three hundred point six milligrams. The titration started at five in the morning and wrapped up at five forty. The buret began at zero and finished at thirty milliliters. The temperature was forty-five degrees Celsius.  

For the second trial, the mass was three hundred thirty-seven point six milligrams. I started at six o’clock and ended at six thirteen. The buret again ran from zero to thirty, and the temperature was fifty-five point five.  

In the third run, I had five hundred point six milligrams. That one began at seven and ended by seven thirty. The buret started at zero and went to thirty-five milliliters. The temperature climbed to sixty degrees.  

The sodium hydroxide solution was made the same day, May fourteenth, with a standardized concentration of zero point three four molar.  

Then I moved to preparing vinegar aliquots. V one was set up on May twenty-fourth at nine oh five in the morning with fifty milliliters vinegar diluted into twelve hundred milliliters water.  
V two was prepared at nine forty with one hundred milliliters vinegar and twelve hundred fifty water.  
V three came at ten o’clock with fifteen milliliters vinegar and three thousand water.  

A few days later, on May thirtieth, I did the titrations. For V one, I began at seven in the evening and ended at eight. The buret went from zero up to fifteen point four six milliliters. The NaOH concentration was zero point six zero molar, and the temperature was twenty-five point nine.  

For V two, the titration lasted from nine until ten at night. The buret went from zero to thirty-five point four zero milliliters, concentration was zero point seven zero molar, and the temperature was twenty-five.  

Finally, V three was done from eleven at night until half past midnight. The buret began at zero and ended at one hundred point five milliliters. The sodium hydroxide concentration there was zero point eight zero molar, temperature twenty-five.
