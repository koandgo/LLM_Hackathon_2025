On November twenty-eighth, twenty twenty-five, I weighed out the TMSOK for the first set of vials.  
E8T1M1 came to twenty point three grams. E8T2M1 was forty-five point six grams, and E8T3M1 was forty-five point seven. For the second row, E8T1M2 measured one hundred point four grams. E8T2M2 was fifty point six, and E8T3M2 was an even fifty grams.  

That weighing started at ten in the morning and wrapped up by eleven.  

For the stock solution, I combined fifty-six milliliters of toluene with two thousand four hundred milligrams of fluorene, seven hundred sixty milligrams of thiophene, and thirty-four milligrams of catalyst. That weighing happened between twelve twenty and one in the afternoon, and the transfer was done at one o’clock.  

The reaction itself began later that evening, at six, and it ran until just after seven, ending at seven oh six.  

The workups happened the following day, November twenty-ninth. For E8T1M1, I worked from one to two thirty. For E8T2M1, I started at three and finished by three twenty. For E8T3M1, it went from four o’clock to four thirty. Then E8T1M2 started at five fifteen and was done by five fifty-four.  

As for the results, E8T1M1 had a vial mass of three thousand four hundred milligrams. The crude was four hundred, and the purified twenty-four point five.  
E8T2M1 came in at eight thousand milligrams, with fifteen hundred crude and five hundred purified.  
E8T3M1 was one thousand milligrams in the vial, crude fifty-six point four, purified twenty-five.  
E8T1M2 weighed forty-five hundred milligrams, with thirty-four point two seven four crude, and fifteen point six purified.
