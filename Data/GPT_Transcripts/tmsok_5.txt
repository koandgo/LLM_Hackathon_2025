On October fifteenth, twenty twenty-five, I started the TMSOK reaction run.  

For the weigh-outs, vial E8T1M1 had sixty-seven grams of TMSOK. E8T2M1 had fifty grams. E8T3M1 came out at forty-five grams. Then E8T1M2 was thirty-five point seven grams, E8T2M2 was twenty-three point five grams, and E8T3M2 again at forty-five grams.  

For the stock solution, I combined one thousand milliliters of toluene with three hundred milligrams of fluorene, five hundred fifty milligrams of thiophene, and five milligrams of catalyst.  

The reaction began on October fifteenth at four thirty in the afternoon and was stopped at five o’clock.  

Then came the workup. For E8T1M1, it was worked up from twelve thirty to one twenty. E8T2M1 was from one thirty to two o’clock. E8T3M1 went from two thirty to three thirty. Then E8T1M2 was handled between three thirty and four. E8T2M2 from four thirty to five thirty. And E8T3M2 was worked up between six thirty and seven.  

For the results, vial E8T1M1 had a starting mass of five hundred milligrams. The crude came to four hundred fifty, and the purified was one hundred.  
E8T2M1 had a vial mass of one thousand four hundred fifty milligrams. The crude was five hundred fifty, and the purified three hundred point eight nine.  
E8T3M1 weighed one thousand milligrams. The crude was six hundred fifty, and the purified one hundred point three.  
Then E8T1M2 repeated the five hundred milligrams down to four hundred fifty, with a purified of one hundred.  
E8T2M2 also mirrored the larger batch: fourteen fifty to five fifty, purified at three hundred point eight nine.  
And finally, E8T3M2 was one thousand milligrams down to six hundred fifty, with one hundred point three purified.
