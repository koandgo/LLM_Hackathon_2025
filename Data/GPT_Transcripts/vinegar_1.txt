So, on September eleventh, twenty twenty-five, I started by standardizing the sodium hydroxide with potassium hydrogen phthalate.  
The first replicate, I weighed out five hundred ten point two milligrams of KHP. I started the titration at four oh five in the afternoon and finished at four twelve. The buret went from zero point zero zero to twenty-five point four eight milliliters, and the temperature was twenty-two point three degrees Celsius.  

For the second replicate, I had four hundred ninety-nine point eight milligrams. That one ran from four eighteen to four twenty-five. The buret started at zero point zero zero and ended at twenty-four point nine five milliliters. The temperature was twenty-two point four.  

Then for the third replicate, the mass was five hundred five point six milligrams. I started at four thirty-one, ended at four thirty-nine. The buret went from zero to twenty-five point two zero, temperature again twenty-two point four.  

After that, the sodium hydroxide titrant was prepared. The standardized concentration was zero point zero nine nine eight molar, and it was made on September eleventh.  

Next, I prepared the vinegar aliquots. The first sample, V one, was done at five oâ€™clock. I measured ten point zero zero milliliters of vinegar and diluted it with fifty point zero milliliters of water.  
Sample V two, at five oh four, same thing: ten milliliters vinegar, fifty milliliters water.  
Sample V three, at five oh eight, also ten milliliters vinegar with fifty milliliters water.  

Then I did the titrations. For V one, on September eleventh, I started at five twelve and finished at five sixteen. The buret went from zero point one zero to sixteen point two three milliliters. Sodium hydroxide concentration was zero point zero nine nine eight molar, temperature twenty-two point five.  

For V two, I started at five twenty-two and ended at five twenty-six. The buret went from zero point zero five to sixteen point one zero milliliters. Same concentration, temperature was twenty-two point six.  

For V three, I started at five thirty-two, ended at five thirty-six. The buret went from zero to sixteen point three five milliliters, with sodium hydroxide at zero point zero nine nine eight molar, temperature twenty-two point six.
