So, on September eleventh, twenty twenty-five, I standardized the sodium hydroxide with potassium hydrogen phthalate… Replicate one ran from four oh-five p.m. to four twelve p.m.; I weighed five hundred ten point two milligrams of KHP; the NaOH buret started at zero point zero zero milliliters and finished at twenty-five point four eight milliliters; temperature was twenty-two point three degrees Celsius.

Replicate two went from four eighteen p.m. to four twenty-five p.m.; the KHP mass was four hundred ninety-nine point eight milligrams; the buret reading moved from zero point zero zero milliliters to twenty-four point nine five milliliters; the temperature was twenty-two point four degrees Celsius.

Replicate three ran from four thirty-one p.m. to four thirty-nine p.m.; I used five hundred five point six milligrams of KHP; the NaOH buret went from zero point zero zero milliliters to twenty-five point two zero milliliters; temperature held at twenty-two point four degrees Celsius.

From those runs, the standardized sodium hydroxide concentration was zero point zero nine nine eight moles per liter, prepared on September eleventh, twenty twenty-five.

Next up, vinegar aliquots… I made three on the same date. V one was prepared at five o’clock p.m. with ten point zero zero milliliters of vinegar and fifty point zero milliliters of dilution water. V two was prepared at five oh-four p.m., again ten point zero zero milliliters of vinegar with fifty point zero milliliters of water. V three was prepared at five oh-eight p.m. with the same ten point zero zero milliliters of vinegar and fifty point zero milliliters of water.

Then I ran the titrations—still September eleventh. For V one, I started at five twelve p.m. and reached the endpoint at five sixteen p.m.; the NaOH buret began at zero point one zero milliliters and ended at sixteen point two three milliliters; the sodium hydroxide concentration was zero point zero nine nine eight moles per liter; the temperature was twenty-two point five degrees Celsius.

For V two, I started at five twenty-two p.m. and finished at five twenty-six p.m.; the buret reading went from zero point zero five milliliters to sixteen point one zero milliliters; I used zero point zero nine nine eight moles per liter sodium hydroxide; the temperature was twenty-two point six degrees Celsius.

For V three, the run was five thirty-two p.m. to five thirty-six p.m.; the buret started at zero point zero zero milliliters and finished at sixteen point three five milliliters; the sodium hydroxide concentration was zero point zero nine nine eight moles per liter; temperature was twenty-two point six degrees Celsius.
