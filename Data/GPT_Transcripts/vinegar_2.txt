On October sixth, twenty twenty-five, I began by standardizing sodium hydroxide against potassium hydrogen phthalate.  
For the first run, I weighed six hundred point two milligrams of KHP. I started the titration at two in the afternoon and wrapped it up by three twelve. The buret reading went from zero to twenty-one milliliters, with the solution at twenty-five degrees Celsius.  

In the second run, the mass was four hundred point eight milligrams. That trial started at three fifteen and finished at four twenty-five. The buret began at zero and stopped at twenty-five milliliters, temperature was twenty-four.  

The third replicate used three hundred twelve point six milligrams. It began at five fifty-five in the evening and ended at six fifty-five. The buret went from zero up to thirteen point eight nine milliliters. Temperature during that one was twenty-one point six.  

The sodium hydroxide stock was then prepared. The standardized molarity came out to zero point one, and it was made on October sixth.  

For the vinegar work, I set up three aliquots. Sample V one was prepared at four oâ€™clock with five point zero zero milliliters of vinegar and one hundred milliliters of water.  
V two was mixed at five oh four, again five milliliters vinegar to one hundred water.  
And V three was done at six ten, same ratio, five to one hundred.  

Later that night, I carried out the titrations. For V one, I started at ten twelve and stopped at ten sixteen. The buret went from zero point one zero up to twenty point two three milliliters. The sodium hydroxide was at zero point one two molar, and the temperature read twenty-five point six.  

For V two, the titration ran from ten twenty-two to ten twenty-six. The buret went from zero point zero five to twenty point one zero milliliters, same concentration, with the temperature at twenty-one degrees.  

Finally, V three was done from ten thirty-two to ten thirty-six. The buret started at zero and ended at twenty point three five milliliters. The NaOH there was zero point one five molar, and the temperature climbed up to forty-five degrees.
