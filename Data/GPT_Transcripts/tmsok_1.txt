On August sixth, twenty twenty-five, I started weighing out the TMSOK samples.  
E8T1M1 was forty-two point nine eight grams. E8T2M1 was forty-four point one two grams. E8T3M1 came to forty-two point six zero. Then E8T1M2 was forty-four point eight seven grams, E8T2M2 was forty-three point four two five, and E8T3M2 was forty-three point four eight.  

The weighing began at one twenty in the afternoon and was finished by five o’clock.  

For the stock solution, I used thirty-seven point five milliliters of toluene, one thousand two hundred twenty-nine milligrams of fluorene, six hundred twenty-four milligrams of thiophene, and fifty-six milligrams of catalyst. That was also weighed between one twenty and five.  

The reaction was started later that day, August sixth, at five in the evening and was allowed to run overnight, ending on August seventh at two thirty-two in the afternoon.  

For the workups, on August seventh:  
E8T1M1 was handled between two thirty-two and three fifty-four.  
E8T2M1 went from four o’clock until five oh two.  
E8T3M1 was between five oh four and five thirty.  
E8T1M2 also ran from two thirty-two to three fifty-four.  
E8T2M2 was four to five oh two.  
And E8T3M2 was five oh four to five thirty.  

For the results, E8T1M1 had a vial mass of eight thousand seven hundred ninety-nine milligrams, with crude at sixty-three point nine nine.  
E8T2M1 was eight thousand eight hundred fifty-two milligrams, crude one hundred three point eight five.  
E8T3M1 was eight thousand eight hundred sixty-two milligrams, crude thirty-three point five five.  
E8T1M2 had eight thousand seven hundred seventy-six milligrams, crude seventy-seven point two seven four.  
E8T1M3 weighed eight thousand seven hundred sixty-four, crude ninety-four point seven two five.  
E8T2M3 was eight thousand eight hundred thirty-three, crude ninety-seven point one nine five.  
E8T1M4 was eight thousand eight hundred forty, crude ninety-three point nine one five.  

The crude product was stored in the fridge, and the samples were dried later under high vacuum. I noticed some oxidation on the polymer within about twenty to thirty minutes after transferring it into vials, so I started filling the vials with nitrogen before storage. Some of the darker solutions made smaller amounts of product, and those often clogged the filter paper, leaving brown spots with nothing to scrape.
