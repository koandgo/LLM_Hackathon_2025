On December twenty-sixth, twenty twenty-five, I started with the TMSOK weigh-outs.  
Vial E8T1M1 contained thirty-five point four nine grams. E8T2M1 had forty grams even, and E8T3M1 was twenty grams.  

The weighing began at one in the afternoon and finished around one thirty.  

Next, I prepared the stock solution. I measured out five hundred fifty milliliters of toluene, two hundred milligrams of fluorene, one hundred milligrams of thiophene, and twenty-five milligrams of catalyst. That was done between two and two thirty, and I transferred it at four o’clock.  

The reaction was started later that same day, December twenty-sixth, at four thirty in the afternoon and stopped at five o’clock.  

The following day, on December twenty-seventh, I worked up the samples. For E8T1M1, I started at twelve thirty and finished by one twenty. E8T2M1 was handled between one thirty and two o’clock, and E8T3M1 from two thirty until three thirty.  

As for the results, E8T1M1 had a vial mass of five hundred milligrams, a crude mass of four hundred fifty, and a purified mass of one hundred.  
E8T2M1 had one thousand four hundred fifty milligrams in the vial, crude five hundred fifty, purified three hundred point eight nine.  
E8T3M1 weighed one thousand milligrams, crude six hundred fifty, purified one hundred point three.
