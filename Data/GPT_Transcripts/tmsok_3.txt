On September twenty-sixth, twenty twenty-five, I started weighing out TMSOK for the experiment.  
For the first replicate, E8T1M1, I measured fifteen point four five grams. E8T2M1 came to twenty point five six, and E8T3M1 was twenty-five point four nine. For the second set, E8T1M2 was thirteen point four five grams. E8T2M2 was much larger, at ninety point four five, and E8T3M2 was sixteen point seven.  

The weighing began at eight in the morning and was wrapped up by eight thirty.  

Then I prepared the stock solution. I combined one hundred milliliters of toluene with fifteen hundred milligrams of fluorene, eight hundred milligrams of thiophene, and fifty milligrams of catalyst. That was weighed out between nine and nine thirty, and I transferred it at ten o’clock.  

The reaction started later that day at noon, on September twenty-sixth, and it continued overnight until nine in the morning on the twenty-seventh.  

For the workups: E8T1M1 was done on the twenty-seventh between twelve thirty and one twenty. E8T2M1 was from one thirty to two o’clock. E8T3M1 went from two thirty to three thirty. E8T1M2 was worked up from five to five fifty-four, and E8T2M2 was handled between six and six thirty.  

As for the product masses:  
E8T1M1 had a vial mass of one thousand milligrams, with five hundred crude and one hundred fifty purified.  
E8T2M1 weighed twelve hundred milligrams, crude six hundred, purified one seventy point eight nine.  
E8T3M1 came to thirteen hundred milligrams, with seven hundred fifty crude and one seventy-seven point three purified.  
E8T1M2 was fourteen hundred milligrams, crude eight hundred, purified four hundred fifty.  
E8T2M2 came to fifteen hundred milligrams, crude nine fifty, purified five hundred forty-six point seven eight.
