On September twenty-fourth, twenty twenty-five, I set up the standardization of sodium hydroxide with potassium hydrogen phthalate.  
For the first measurement, I weighed out one thousand milligrams of KHP. I began at seven thirty-five in the morning and ended around eight oh one. The buret started at zero and ended at fifty milliliters, and the temperature was one hundred degrees Celsius.  

The second replicate used three hundred forty-six milligrams. That trial ran from eight thirty until just after nine. The buret went from zero to thirteen point four five milliliters, and the temperature held at twenty-three point five.  

In the third replicate, I had one thousand four hundred thirty-five point nine milligrams. It went from ten in the morning until eleven. The buret began at ten milliliters and ended at twenty-three point four nine. The temperature was fifty-six degrees.  

The sodium hydroxide stock solution had already been standardized on October twenty-ninth, with a concentration of zero point four five molar.  

Next, I moved on to preparing the vinegar samples. Sample V one was set up at ten o’clock with twenty-four point five milliliters of vinegar diluted into one hundred milliliters of water.  
Sample V two was prepared at ten thirty with ten milliliters vinegar into twelve hundred forty milliliters of water.  
Sample V three was done at eleven o’clock with eleven milliliters vinegar and three thousand water.  

Then I carried out the titrations on September thirtieth. For V one, I started at five o’clock in the evening and stopped at five twenty. The buret went from zero up to twelve point five six milliliters, with sodium hydroxide at zero point two five molar. The temperature was thirty degrees.  

For V two, the titration was from five thirty to seven. The buret went from zero point zero five up to fifty milliliters, with NaOH at zero point five molar, temperature twenty-five point six.  

For V three, I worked from nine to nine thirty that night. The buret started at zero point two three and finished at twenty-one point four five milliliters. The NaOH was zero point one molar, and the temperature rose to fifty-one point four degrees.
