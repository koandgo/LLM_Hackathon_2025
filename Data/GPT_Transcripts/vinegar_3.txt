On October thirtieth, twenty twenty-five, I carried out the sodium hydroxide standardization using potassium hydrogen phthalate.  
For the first replicate, I measured three hundred forty-six milligrams. The titration started at nine in the morning and was done by nine ten. The buret started at zero and ended at twenty-three point six milliliters. The temperature was twenty-two point three degrees Celsius.  

In the second replicate, I weighed two hundred thirty-five point nine milligrams. That one went from nine thirty to ten oâ€™clock. The buret began at one point four five and finished at thirty-two milliliters, with a temperature of fifteen point six.  

The third replicate used exactly three hundred milligrams. I began at ten thirty and finished by eleven. The buret went from two point zero zero up to thirty-two point six milliliters. The temperature there was thirty-seven point five.  

The sodium hydroxide solution was prepared a day earlier, on October twenty-ninth. Its concentration was standardized at zero point four five molar.  

Then I got the vinegar samples ready. Sample V one was mixed at one in the afternoon with ten milliliters of vinegar and two hundred milliliters of water.  
V two was made at one thirty-five with four milliliters of vinegar and three hundred milliliters of water.  
V three was prepared at two fifty-six with three point four five milliliters vinegar and three hundred water.  

Later that day, I ran the titrations. For V one, I began at five fifteen and finished five twenty. The buret went from zero point zero seven to ten point two three milliliters. The sodium hydroxide was zero point one molar, and the temperature was twenty-five.  

For V two, the titration was from five thirty to six. The buret moved from zero point zero three to thirty-four point one zero milliliters, with NaOH at zero point one molar and the temperature at twenty-four point three.  

Finally, for V three, I started at six thirteen and ended at seven. The buret began at zero point one five and ended at twenty point three five milliliters. The NaOH concentration was zero point two zero molar, and the temperature climbed to fifty degrees Celsius.
