So, on August sixth, twenty twenty-five, I started the weigh-out at one twenty p.m.…

For E8T1, I measured E8T1M1 at forty-two point nine eight grams; E8T1M2 at forty-four point eight seven grams; E8T1M3 at forty-six point four nine grams; E8T1M4 at forty-four point five three grams.

For E8T2, I measured E8T2M1 at forty-four point one two grams; E8T2M2 at forty-three point four two five grams; E8T2M3 at forty-six point one nine grams; E8T2M4 at forty-three point four seven grams.

For E8T3, I measured E8T3M1 at forty-two point six zero grams; E8T3M2 at forty-three point four eight grams; E8T3M3 at forty-two point three eight grams; E8T3M4 at forty-five point six zero grams.

In the setup, I laid out twelve vials with stir bars… I transferred forty-two milliliters of toluene per reaction… I purged the powder vessel with nitrogen five times… then added thirty-seven point five milliliters to dissolve and dispensed three point zero milliliters into each vial. I set the hotplate to twenty-five degrees Celsius with moderate stirring at one hundred eighty revolutions per minute… and I also recorded forty degrees Celsius later on.

The reaction ran from August sixth, twenty twenty-five at five o’clock p.m. to August seventh, twenty twenty-five at two thirty-two p.m.

Work-up went like this— E8T1M1 on August seventh, twenty twenty-five from two thirty-two p.m. to three fifty-four p.m.; E8T2M1 on August seventh, twenty twenty-five from four o’clock p.m. to five oh-two p.m.; E8T3M1 on August seventh, twenty twenty-five from five oh-four p.m. to five thirty p.m.

Then— E8T1M2 on August seventh, twenty twenty-five from two thirty-two p.m. to three fifty-four p.m.; E8T2M2 on August seventh, twenty twenty-five from four o’clock p.m. to five oh-two p.m.; E8T3M2 on August seventh, twenty twenty-five from five oh-four p.m. to five thirty p.m.

Next— E8T1M3 on August seventh, twenty twenty-five from two thirty-two p.m. to three fifty-four p.m.; E8T2M3 on August seventh, twenty twenty-five from four o’clock p.m. to five oh-two p.m.; E8T3M3 on August seventh, twenty twenty-five from five oh-four p.m. to five thirty p.m.

And finally— E8T1M4 on August seventh, twenty twenty-five from two thirty-two p.m. to three fifty-four p.m.; E8T2M4 on August seventh, twenty twenty-five from four o’clock p.m. to five oh-two p.m.; E8T3M4 on August seventh, twenty twenty-five from five oh-four p.m. to five thirty p.m.

For the mass results, E8T1M1 recorded eight thousand seven hundred ninety-nine point zero three five milligrams and sixty-three point ninety-nine milligrams; the third field wasn’t filled in. E8T2M1 recorded eight thousand eight hundred fifty-two point one one five milligrams and one hundred three point eighty-five milligrams; the third field wasn’t filled in. E8T3M1 recorded eight thousand eight hundred sixty-two point nine four five milligrams and thirty-three point fifty-five milligrams; the third field wasn’t filled in. E8T1M2 recorded eight thousand seven hundred seventy-six point eight five six milligrams and seventy-seven point two seven four milligrams; the third field wasn’t filled in. For E8T2M2, no mass values were entered… and for E8T3M2, no mass values were entered.
